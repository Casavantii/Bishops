# Bishops

Found some of the projects from my University courses.

Missing C++ code from intro to programming, Swift from App development, Website from Dynamic Web Dev. Probably from broken laptop, which I repaired, but with the data loss, bless its data soul. 

Since that time at school, I learned:
  Commenting
  Testing (learning)
  Concrete maths (Proofs and patience)
  Linux, Bash
  Javascript (all that Java really helped)
  Documenting
  Server setup
  Oracle 12c
  Python
  Dynamic web dev - modern (learning)
